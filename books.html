<h3>"Go, go, go!" Screamed a soldier. Lasers were flying at both sides. Soldiers were all doing their best to avoid getting shot by taking cover, but it's hard to take cover in a long, open hallway. "Aaagghh!" Cried a soldier as he dropped to the ground, a hole in his chest. Another soldier dropped to the ground beside him with a cry of agony. "Medic, medic, medic!" Yelled a third soldier adjacent to his comrades after checking them with a scanner (even the guy with the hole in his chest [such awesome medical tech]). The leader of this battalion, General Chameron Seens, was one of the best generals in the entire US space corps. "RETREAT!" Cried General Seens. He turned and killed several enemy troops with his dual laser pistols. Immediately, his battalion responded, moving quickly and only turning back to return enemy fire or pick up an injured trooper. It was a while before they exited the hallway and entered a maze of corridors, rooms, and elevators that could go side to side. The retreating battalion soon reached the XXXXXXXXXXL elevator. "They changed the code!" General Seens yelled over the silent guns and the cries of death.</h3>
